### Reimbursement App

This is a full-stack mobile application built with Flutter to simplify and automate the employee reimbursement process. The app allows employees to quickly submit expense claims by taking a picture of a bill, which uses OCR to pre-fill form details, reducing manual data entry and speeding up the approval workflow.

### Key Features

  * **Custom Authentication:** Secure employee login and role-based access management.
  * **Bill Submission:** Users can submit new bills by selecting an image from their gallery, using their camera, or uploading a PDF.
  * **Intelligent OCR:** Utilizes **Google ML Kit** to automatically recognize and extract key data like the amount and date from bill images, pre-filling the submission form.
  * **Real-time Status Tracking:** Employees can view their last 5 recent submissions directly on their home screen.
  * **Full History:** A dedicated history page displays a complete list of all past submissions.
  * **Admin Workflow (Planned):** The backend is structured to support an administrator dashboard for reviewing, approving, or rejecting claims.
